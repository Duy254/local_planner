SUBSCRIBE: /pose that will have pose of current location of Cabot from localizer node geometry_msgs/Pose2D

PUBLISH: /leftval - float32 left motor velocity
	/rightval - float32 right motor velocity


-User has to manually publish current position to /pose topic 

-When localization is integrated, current location will be continually updated by subsribing to the node 

-Grabs waypoints from the .yaml file in the config directory

-MIGHT NEED TO CHANGE MATH EQUATIONS AFTER TESTING (map velocities differently)
