SUBSCRIBE: /pose that will have pose of current location of Cabot from localizer node geometry_msgs/Pose2D

PUBLISH: /leftval - float32 left motor velocity
	/rightval - float32 right motor velocity


-Currently is not subsribing to anything and will send a right and left motor velocity based on a current location and a final location that is hardcoded 

-When localization is integrated, current location will be continually updated by subsribing to the node 

-Will also need a way to grab goal waypoints might be able to hard code a list of waypoints on here first but will need to update location to test this out. 

-MIGHT NEED TO CHANGE MATH EQUATIONS AFTER TESTING (map velocities differently)
